# Deep_Respiration
This repository contains implementations of four different deep learning-based algorithms for remote respiration rate estimation from thermal camera recordings: PhsyNet, DeepPhys, StressNet, and PhysLSTM. These algorithms leverage the power of deep learning techniques implemented using PyTorch.

# Algorithms Implemented
PhsyNet: A deep learning-based algorithm for respiration rate estimation from thermal imagery.
DeepPhys: Another deep learning approach tailored for remote respiration rate estimation using thermal camera recordings.
StressNet: A method designed specifically for stress detection from physiological signals including respiration rate obtained from thermal imaging.
PhysLSTM: A novel deep learning-based algorithm developed as part of this project, utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for respiration rate estimation from thermal camera recordings.
